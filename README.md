> POC to exercise the combination of DropWizard + Feign + WireMock

#### Notes

- There's a Postman collection in the ```./etc```
- Currently, there's only a single request that fetches all the *public* repositories from the specified user
- There's only a single test in the ```GithubIntegrationTest```, still a WIP
